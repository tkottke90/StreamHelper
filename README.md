# Stream Helper App

I like to stream the sim racing I do on Youtube and have strived to produce as close to a production-like cast as possible. When I race with my team (Wrong Side Up) I am able to go even further and show what has the look and feel of a broadcast while I stream.  The key downsides that I have had are:

1. When I am driving the audience is locked into my cockpit view for the duration of my stint (turn)
2. It is difficult to show replays from revealing perspectives because I only have the perspective the replay was captured in and rewinding would break the immersion of a live broadcast
3. Assets such as countdowns or stats are difficult to manage in real-time because they currently require editing custom HTML
4. I have no integrations with iRacing so there are no possibilities for automation
5. I would love to add AI to either my stream OR to my driving experience in general.

 This application is designed to drive towards approaching these problems to further enhance my experience with streaming sim racing and reach the goal of broadcasting while also racing.
