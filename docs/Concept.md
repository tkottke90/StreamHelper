# Concept

To start designing this software I started with a Concept Design. This design approaches the problem free of technology or implementation details.  Before picking those we first need to _understand_ what is involved. This step produced this document:

![design-img](./Concept%20Design.20241126.png)

The design itself is broken up into [Internal](#internal-components) (components that must be build) and _External_ (components that must be integrated with).

## Internal Components

The Internal components can be primarily broken down into 4 main sections:

1. User
2. Streams
3. Stream Assets
4. AI Feedback

### Users

As with most software, data security is a priority.  Users who use this system will be exposing their private data to the system and should have full control over who has access to it.  This requires that a concept of a user exists in the system to correlate that user to their data. 

> Note: Users themselves will not be managed by the application and instead be offloaded to an external login solution which uses OAuth2 in order to integrate.  This will allow the users account information to be managed externally by a proven service and offload the burden of user management/authentication from the software itself.

### Streams

Users will have the capability to direct their streaming software of choice to send the stream to the server.  This will allow others to use that stream as an input which will close the gap on the complexity of broadcasting and solving the single view problem outlined in the Readme.

Further more, users should be able to forward their stream to the streaming platform of their choice should they wish to "multi-cast" their stream to both the server for use with another users stream AND push their stream to their own accounts (for example Youtube).  

### Stream Assets

Developing a stream typically requires showing dynamic data.  This could be a lineup of the racers on track, it could be a countdown till the stream starts, or it could be some custom adds which show up.  For my purposes using OBS, it is possible to pull in Browser Sources which can be websites and websites are just HTML/CSS/JS.  This means we can build custom stream assets and provide them via the application.  

### iRacing Telemetry Data

To further enhance the Stream Assets, we can leverage the iRacing Telemetry to pull data from the users's session for use with the application.  This has the power to drive more complex stream interactions and data visualizations which pull data directly from the game and display it for the audience.

### AI Feedback

There is an opportunity to add in AI to the system.  The AI has the potential to take in user input along with the telemetry data to either (A) answer questions or (B) act as an assistant with the stream or co-producer.  This system would require the application have a way to capture the users voice so that it can be converted to text, sent to a Large Language Model, converted to audio, and sent to the users speakers.

In addition there is potential for the AI to be a sort-of engineer for the user taking the iRacing data and interpreting the results in order to provide feedback during a race.

## External Components

As with any project, it is important to understand what the application should be responsible for, what has to be integrated, and what can be outsourced.  For this application there are a couple of external components

1. **External User Management** - There are many solutions today which allow an application to expose authentication/authorization technologies and manage the users.  For example, social logins like Gmail, Facebook, Github, and Apple provide ways for users to use existing accounts to login.  Those services manage the users account including maintenance actives like password reset.
2. **iRacing Telemetry** - The telemetry itself is output by the iRacing game and therefore cannot be generated by the application
3. **Large Language Model Engine** - Many solutions exist for 
4. **OBS Websockets** - A feature of the OBS ecosystem is a web socket server plugin which allows a user to control their stream from another device.  This would (potentially) allow the server to use things like AI Feedback & iRacing Telemetry to control the stream.
