# Node JS API Boilerplate

This is a Template Repository for building NodeJS REST APIs using Express.  It follows 2 key patterns for implementation: **MVC Style Controllers** and **Data Access/Transfer Objects**.  The implementation here borrows from the Spring Boot design pattern using _decorators_ (or _annotations_ for Java folks) to build out a REST API based on classes and class methods.

## Other Modules I Use with this One

- [HATOS URL Manager](https://github.com/tkottke90/hateos-url-manager) - Another module I wrote which abstracts some of the complexity of adding `_links` to your API responses.
